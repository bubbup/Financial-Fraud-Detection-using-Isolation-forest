#  Fraud Detection Using Isolation Forest

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to detect fraudulent transactions using the **Isolation Forest** algorithm, an unsupervised machine learning method for anomaly detection.

##  Project Overview

Fraudulent transactions are typically rare and differ from normal transactions. This project uses the Isolation Forest algorithm to flag such anomalies based on transaction features without requiring labeled data.

##  Key Features

- Unsupervised learning using Isolation Forest
- Preprocessing including scaling and encoding
- Anomaly detection with visualization

## File Structure

```bash
fraud_detection_using_isolation_forests.ipynb   # Main notebook
README.md                                       # Project documentation
```

##  Concepts Used

- **Isolation Forest** for anomaly detection
- **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for data handling and visualization

---

##  How to Run

1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**.
2. Upload your transaction dataset (CSV file).
3. Execute the cells to train the model and detect anomalies.



##  Results

- The model flags rare, unusual transactions.
- Visual insights into transaction distributions and detected anomalies.
- Exportable model for integration in production pipelines.

---

##  Limitations

- Requires careful tuning of the `contamination` parameter.
- No ground truth labels; manual validation is needed.
- May detect rare but legitimate transactions as fraud (false positives).

---

## Future Improvements

- Combine with supervised learning when labels are available
- Add real-time fraud alerting system
- Deploy as a Flask or FastAPI web service
